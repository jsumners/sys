sys

Features

* Wraps systemctl and service/chkconfig.
* Makes them more inclined to understand what you mean.
* Will never believe that "start" or "stop" is the name of a service.

Info

* GPL2

Tip

* Let your user execute /usr/bin/systemctl (or /sbin/service + /sbin/ckgconfig) with sudo without a password for added comfort (and a slightly increased security risk)
